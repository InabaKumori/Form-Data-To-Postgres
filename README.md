# Project Name: Form-Data-To-Postgres

## Description

`Form-Data-To-Postgres` is a Node.js API designed to simplify the process of receiving client contact form submissions and persisting them in a PostgreSQL database. This backend service validates the received data from the client-side and stores it securely in a database for further processing or analysis. It's a robust and efficient way to manage user-generated data coming from web forms.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/InabaKumori/Form-Data-To-Postgres.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder
   ```bash
   cd Form-Data-To-Postgres
   ```

3. Install required packages
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the application
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

## Usage

To test the API, make a `POST` request to `http://localhost:30000/post/contact` with the appropriate form data.

Here is a sample cURL request:
```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:30000/post/contact' \
--form 'name="John Doe"' \
--form 'email="john.doe@email.com"' \
--form 'message="Hello, World!"'
```

## API Endpoints

- **POST /post/contact**: Endpoint for receiving form data.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following:

```
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual PostgreSQL database information.

## Database Setup

Here's an example SQL command to create the table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE contact_forms (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  message TEXT
);
```

## Error Handling

Error responses come in the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message goes here"
}
```
